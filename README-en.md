# turntable
When you install and enable this add-on in Blender, a tab called "Turntable" will appear on the right side of the 3D viewport, providing a UI for creating turntable animations. Clicking the "Create" button in the UI will set up a turntable animation, creating an animation where the camera rotates around a circle.

When using this add-on, you can adjust the parameters of the turntable animation through the UI it provides. You can also access and customize each operator and property defined in the code.

### How to Use:

1. **Installing the Plugin:**
   - Save the plugin's code as a text file.
   - Launch Blender and select "Edit" > "Preferences" from the menu.
   - Go to the "Add-ons" tab and click the "Install" button, then select the saved plugin file.
   - Once the plugin appears in the list, enable it by checking the checkbox.

2. **Using the Plugin:**
   - In Blender's 3D viewport, you'll see a tab called "Turntable" on the right side.
   - Click the "Turntable" tab to access the turntable animation setup.
   
3. **Setting Up the Animation:**
   - In the "Frames" field, input the number of frames for the animation. This determines the number of frames it takes for the camera to make one full rotation around the circle.
   - Click the "Create Camera" button to generate the turntable animation. This will create a camera that moves along a circular path.

4. **Playing the Animation:**
   - To play the created animation, manipulate the Blender timeline and click the play button.

### Notes:

- This plugin is in beta, and its stability may not be guaranteed. It's recommended to create backups and use it with caution, especially for important projects.

- As of version 0.0.0, if you want to change the number of frames, you need to delete the objects first. This may be improved in future updates.
